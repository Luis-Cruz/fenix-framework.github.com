We've just completed the migration of all features from the 1.x development
branch to the current development branch (2.x).

Fenix Framework 2.1 is almost out!  After the release of 2.0, 2.1 will be the
first release to fully integrate all the previous features from 1.x versions.  

Expect a release soon!
