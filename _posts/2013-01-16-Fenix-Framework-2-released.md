This is a nice post saying that Fénix Framework 2.0 just got released.  This
is also the first post that inaugurates this new site's blog.

Fénix Framework has undergone a huge refactoring from version 1.x to 2.0.
Read all about the new stuff in the documentation available from the
[main page][FF-web-page].
